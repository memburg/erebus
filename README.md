# Erebus

Erebus is a work to help you share content on the internet and preserve your privacy.

# How it works?

| ![](./docs/resources/lenna.gif) | This is an example of an encrypted 100x100 image; this is basically what happens behind the scenes, notice how the rows and columns are randomly modified. |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

## How to run?

Since Erebus is still under development, only Windows is supported; MAC and Linux will eventually be able to run this.

### Windows

Run the following command from the command line:

```
./erebus -i <input_image> -its <number_of_iterations>
```

## Results


| **Original**                    | **Encrypted (I = 1000)**             | **Encrypted (I = 2000)**             | **Encrypted (I = 5000)**             |
